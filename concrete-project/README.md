# SJSU CMPE255 Final Project - Team 7

This project utilized multiple classification approaches to identify whether or not an image of concrete is structurally sound by identifying cracks in the concrete surface. Three different classification approaches were examined during the course of the project: (1) support vector machines (SVMs), (2) convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and (3) decision trees (DTs).

## Repository Info
In this repo you will find Python Jupyter Notebooks, trained models and a small set of test data.
Each folder represents the solution for each classifier.  In each folder there are 2 notebooks, one to show the work done to process the data and train the model and one test file which will load the trained model and predict the labels for a small set of test data (this is the recommended notebook to run)
